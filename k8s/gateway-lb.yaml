# Note: Envoy Gateway automatically creates services for Gateways
# This file documents the expected service configuration.
# The Envoy Gateway service will be created automatically when the Gateway resource is deployed.
# 
# To configure MetalLB for the Gateway service, ensure:
# 1. MetalLB is installed in the metallb-system namespace
# 2. IPAddressPool and L2Advertisement are applied (see metallb-address-pool.yaml)
# 3. The Gateway resource has MetalLB annotations (see gateway.yaml)
#
# The Envoy Gateway controller service will be named something like:
# - envoy-gateway-system/gateway-envoy-<namespace>-<gateway-name>-<listener-name>
#
# You may need to patch the automatically created service with MetalLB annotations:
# kubectl annotate service <envoy-gateway-service> \
#   -n envoy-gateway-system \
#   metallb.universe.tf/address-pool=dataknife-ai-pool \
#   metallb.universe.tf/loadBalancerIPs=192.168.18.10
